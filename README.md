Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python

Here you have SLAPP v.0.95 (in the [SLAPP repository](http://eco83.econ.unito.it/terna/slapp_dep) you have related material and old versions).

A reference manual is coming (expected with version 1.0, in August 2015).

Five chapters of a new [book](http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/agentbased-models-of-the-economy-/?K=9781137339805) are related to SLAPP.
