You are supposed to have downloaded SLAPP as a zip file and to have unzipped it.

SLAPP, as Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python, has in folder # 6,
“6 objectSwarmObserverAgents_AESOP_turtleLib_NetworkX”, its full implementation.

You can use it as an agent-based shell, keeping unmodified the basic part contained
into the $$slapp$$ folder.

Install the required libraries (as explained in the two Warning files
into that folder and, must of all, in the Appendix A of the Reference Handbook
that you can find in this same folder).

Then, from the main folder of SLAPP, run

python runShell.py

and chose one of the three project examples:

basic

school

production

(Look at README.md in this folder, for a graphical presentation.)

There are also a 'debug' project and a 'basic2classes' one: have a look
the the Reference Manual.
