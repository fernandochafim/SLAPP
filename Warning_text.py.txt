With the current version of Matplotlib (1.3.4), we have an annoying warning
message when producing graphics.

To avoid it substitute the text.py file in your python folder chain with that
patched that you find in the main folder of the SLAPP GitHub
(\url{https://github.com/terna/SLAPP}) v.1.2;
before copying, rename your existing text.py file.

My changes are after \verb"Pietro Terna's correction" sign.
