With the current version of Matplotlib (1.3.4), if SLAPP runs in a notebook,
via IPython, we have an annoying warning message when producing graphics.

To avoid it put in \verb"anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib"
(supposing to use Anaconda distribution) the patched file text.py that you
find in the main folder of the SLAPP GitHub
(\url{https://github.com/terna/SLAPP});
before copying, rename your existing text.py file.

My changes are after \verb"Pietro Terna's correction" sign.
